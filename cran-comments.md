## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated the Description to write package names in single quotes e.g: 'ggplot2'

* Not added any references describing the methods in this package as I'm not aware of any that need to be listed. To the best of my knowledge, no references are needed.


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 2 notes

* This is a new release. 

* To date, there are no references that need to be provided for the methods within this package.
